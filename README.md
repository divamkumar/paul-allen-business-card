## About
Calling all American Psycho fans! Here is a LaTex template of Paul Allen's business card. The subtle off-white coloring, the tasteful thickness of it, and the watermark are not included, unfortunately (they have to be done by the printers).

### Requirements
- Download the Copperplate Gothic Regular font as well as the Copperplate Gothic Bold Regular from the internet and upload their respective `.otf` and `.ttf` files into the same directory where main.tex is.
- Set `texStudio` to compile with `XeLaTeX`.

### Usage
- In the `main.tex` use the space between the `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}` to piece together components, as well as alter spacing between the components using `\vspace{}`.
- To change the components, check out the `Components` folder and alter the `.tex` files there. 
- To alter the dimensions of the file, check the first 20 files of the `main.tex` file where the dimensions are set and other packages are installed.
